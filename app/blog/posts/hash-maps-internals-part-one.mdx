# Introduction to HashMaps

So what exactly are HashMaps? Well if you have ever used a simple key-value pair data structure then you've probably
used a hashmap. HashMaps are a simple Key-Value pair data structure that allow you to store a key and map some value
to it.

They can store arbitrary value that you want to store in them and can be fetched later whenever the developer demands
it. However, the core value they provide is not the simplicity but rather the ability to store and fetch data in a
constant time that is `O(1)` (_though not necessarily true, we will talk about this a little later_). Quite fascinating
right you have a data structure that is not only simple to use but extremely fast!

Let's first see how are HashMaps defined across several languages and I bet you've seen these:

In JavaScript though there is not a direct HashMap object however there is a Map which behaves exactly like a HashMap
would. You can perform `Add`, `Update`, `Remove` operations on it in a constant time with a predictable flow.
```javascript
const hashmap = new Map();

hashmap.set("key", "value");
```

C++ exposes two containers called `std::unordered_map` and `std::map` the core difference being that `std::map` runs on
a `O(log n)` time complexity because they internally use `Red-black trees`.
```c++
std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> u = {
        {"RED", "#FF0000"},
        {"GREEN", "#00FF00"},
        {"BLUE", "#0000FF"}
};
```

Go (which we'll be using today) has something similar which it calls map!
```go
m := make(map[string]int)

m["route"] = 666
i, ok := m["route"]
```

Aside of the syntactic difference you'll observe that the idea behind them stays the same, they are a Key-Value pair
that can be stored and fetched very quickly.

## 😶‍🌫️ The truth behind the pretty face!

Maps, HashMaps, HashTables — whatever you want to call them — are nothing but clever abstractions built atop some
surprisingly simple and fundamental data structures, engineered to be fast and powerful.

If I were to write a recipe for a HashMap, it’d go something like this:

Ingredients to make a Tasty HashMap:

1. A good hashing function 🍯
2. An array of buckets 🍱
3. Buckets that hold key-value pairs 🔑📦
4. Plus a cup of coffee — never hurts :p ☕

Under the hood, a HashMap stores a collection of key-value pairs inside an array. But how they’re
structured is what makes them interesting. Consider this basic struct:

```go
type Entry struct {
    Key   string
    Value int
}
```

The `Key` represents the key (`"route"` if we take the above Go example) you wanted to store a `Value` against. And the
`Value` is of course the value you wanted to store or map it to.

A simple HashMap might be something like this:

```go
type HashMap struct {
    table [][]Entry
}
```

That `table` is our main array — and each index holds a bucket (`[]Entry`), which is itself a slice of Entry's.
But wait, why would we need multiple entries in a single bucket?

```
[ <--stuff--, [{Key: "the_cutest", Value: "you_of_course"}], --stuff--> ]
```

Glad you asked 😏

Let’s walk through what happens when you want to store a key like "foo" with a value like "bar":

1. The moment you insert "foo", the HashMap sends the key to the hash function.
2. The hash function returns an unsigned integer — a hash of the key.
3. Since this integer could be wildly large, we tame it by using modulo: `idx := int(Hash(KEY) % uint64(len(table)))`
4. Now idx is guaranteed to be within bounds — between 0 and n - 1, where n is the size of our array.
5. Using this index, we find the bucket and insert our `{Key, Value}` pair there.
6. If there’s already something in that bucket (that is, we hit a collision), we either:
    - Update the value if the key already exists.
    - Append the new entry if it’s a different key entirely.

Boom! 🎉
Just like that, you've got yourself a working (and beautiful) little HashMap.

Could you believe it’s really that simple? Okay... maybe not that simple. But hey, the gist is all there 😉

## The idea of Hashing

According to WikiPedia, a Hash or a Hashing function is defined as follows:

_*A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values,
... The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, (hash/message) digests,
or simply hashes.*_

Think of a function which given an _arbitrary input_, converts it into something more predictable or bounded. Or maybe
a function that is capable of converting a huge object to a number for example:

```
fn(x any) -> int
```

That is a huge oversimplification, of course. But, how about this toy function in Go?

```go
func Convert(str string) int {
    sum := 0
    for _, char := range str {
        sum += int(char)
    }

    return sum
}

func main() {
	something := Convert("Sourav is NOT a beta!")
	fmt.Println(something) // Prints `1771`

	something2 := Convert("Sourav is NOT a beta!")
	fmt.Println(something2) // Prints `1771`
}
```

Observe that the function accepts a string `str` and then loops over every rune in that string and converts each rune/char
into an integer `int(char)` and then sums it up. It's a function given a string `str` will convert that string and
return an `int`. However, notice that no matter how many times I call it with the same input, it always returns the
same result — a _pure_ function to be accurate. Being deterministic and pure is what defines a good _hash function_.

And now you know hashing, the above function for sure isn't a sophisticated hashing function, but it represents the idea.
A Hash function can be used to map data of arbitrary size (our string) to a fixed-size value (integer).
